## To build

### With OPAM

If you have [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org) installed on your system,
`opam install ott` will install the latest Ott version.  The Emacs mode
will be in `` `opam config var prefix`/share/ott/emacs ``, and documentation in
`` `opam config var prefix`/doc/ott ``.

To install the Ott auxiliary files for Coq, first activate the
`coq-released` OPAM repository:

`opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released`

and then run `opam install coq-ott`.

### Without OPAM

Ott depends on OCaml version 4.00.0 or later. It builds with (at
least) OCaml 4.02.3.

The command `make` (`make world`) builds the `ott` binary in the `bin/` subdirectory.

This will compile Ott using `ocamlopt`.  To force it to
compile with `ocamlc` (which may give significantly slower execution
of Ott), do `make world.byt`.

To build the Ott auxiliary files for Coq, go to the `coq/` subdirectory
and run `make`. To install the resulting files in Coq's `user-contrib`,
run `make install`.

## To run

Ott runs as a command-line tool. Executing `bin/ott` shows the
usage and options.  To run Ott on the test file
`tests/test10.ott`, generating LaTeX in `test10.tex` and
Coq in `test10.v`, type:

  `bin/ott -i tests/test10.ott -o test10.tex -o test10.v`

Isabelle, HOL, and Lem can be generated with options `-o test10.thy`,
`-o test10Script.sml`, and `-o test10.lem`, respectively.

The Makefile has various sample targets, `make tests/test10.out`,
`make test7`, etc.  Typically they generate:

filename          | description
----------------  | ----------------------------------
`out.tex`         | LaTeX source for a definition
`out.ps`          | the postscript built from that
`out.v`           | Coq source
`outScript.sml`   | HOL source
`out.thy`         | Isabelle source

from files `test10.ott`, `test8.ott`, etc., in `tests/`.

## Manual

* in the [Ott github](https://github.com/ott-lang/ott) built_doc directory, or 
* [here (html)](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/ott/ott_manual_0.27.html)

## Emacs mode

The file `emacs/ott-mode.el` defines a very simple Emacs mode for syntax
highlighting of Ott source files.  It can be used by, for example,
adding the following to your `.emacs` file, replacing `PATH` by a path to your
Ott Emacs directory.

```ELisp
(setq load-path (cons (expand-file-name "PATH") load-path))
(require 'ott-mode)
```
