- remove doc references to the Windows binary distribution.  It should
   be easy to build from source, but we don't have access to a
   suitable machine.


2010.3.24 Version 0.10.18alpha

- The previous command-line options -coq, -hol, etc., are no longer
  supported; they should be replaced by -o. 

- By default (unless -merge true is set) the order of the input file 
  is preserved, so one can have mixed sequences of definitions of
  grammar, of inductive relations, and of embed blocks.

- New command-line options -i <filename> and -o <filename> for
  specifying multiple input and output files.  Input files with
  non-.ott extensions (.v, .thy, .sml, .ml, .tex) are copied verbatim
  into the respective outputs.  The command-line order of these
  options is significant:  the prover output can be split into
  multiple output files; each prover output file specified with -o
  will contain the material from the previous input files specified
  with -i (since the last -o for this prover).

- Better tex default spacing, distinguishing alphabetic and other
  ("symbolic") terminals based on their ott source strings and
  wrapping them in \ottkw{} and \ottsym{} respectively. 

- Support for in-line prover code in premises, e.g.

   {{ prover code mentioning [[x]] and [[\y.z]] }}
   -----------------------------------------------  ::  rulename
   conclusion

- The {{ phantom }} hom can now be applied to metavariables and to
  nonterminal rules.  In both cases it suppresses generation of a prover
  or OCaml definition, but any type homs are taken into account when
  the metavariable or nonterminal root is output as a type. 

- There is a new hom {{ order ... }} that can be applied to
  productions which lets one specify the order of arguments of a
  prover or OCaml constructor independently of the order in which they
  appear in the production.  For example, one might say:

     | e1 e2   :: :: ReversedApp {{ order [[e2]] [[e1]] }}

- There is a new hom {{ coq-universe UniverseName }} that can be
  applied to metavariable or nonterminal rules, eg to force Ott to
  generate definitions in Type instead of in Set. 

- Changed some debug options (eg show-pre-sort)

- Ocaml list homs on productions are now permitted 

- add coq_lngen option for compatibility with the lngen tool

- Bug fixes:
   - problem with comment line in defns terminated with EOF [Jianzhou Zhao]
   - freshness of identifier in Ott generated functions [Jianzhou Zhao]
   - processing of parse tree for some cases of dot forms [Scott Owens]
   - processing of picky_multiple_parses [Scott Owens]
   - added some error checks
   - several fixes in the Coq locally-nameless backend [Stephanie Weirich]
   - performance issue when using contextrules [Nicolas Pouillard]
   - parens in OCaml substitutions for multiple binders [Vilhelm Sjoberg]


2010.03.29 Version 0.20

- The order among mutually recursive nonterminal definitions in
  grammar blocks is now preserved in prover output. 

2010.04.04 Version 0.20.1

- Support coq-universe hom on blocks of definitions, eg:

    defns
    Jop :: '' ::= {{ coq-universe Type }}

     defn
     t1 --> t2 :: ::reduce::'' by


        --------------------------  :: ax_app
        (\x.t1) v2 -->  {v2/x}t1


2010.06.29

- refactor the generated latex for grammars so that condensed grammars
  can be produced by redefining a couple of latex commands, eg

    \renewcommand{\ottgrammartabular}[1]{{\raggedright #1}}
    \renewcommand{\ottrulehead}[3]{$#1$  $#2$ }
    \renewcommand{\ottprodline}[6]{{}\ ${}#1$\mbox{\ {}$#2$}{}}
    \renewcommand{\ottfirstprodline}[6]{{}\ ${}$\mbox{\ {}$#2$}{}}
    \renewcommand{\ottprodnewline}{}
    \renewcommand{\ottinterrule}{\\[1mm]} 

- add experimental option (-ocaml_include_terminals true) to include, in
   generated OCaml types, an instance of "terminal" in all the places
   where there's a terminal in the AST

- gforge bugtracker now in use:https://gforge.inria.fr/tracker/?group_id=2980

2010.11.28 Version 0.20.3

- fixes to bugs: 

    11367 coq-universe Type problem with non-native lists
    11368 generation of induction principles in Ott 0.20
    11369 0 and O in generated Ott lists
    11377 {{}} hypothesis and ln backend
    11378 context rules and ln backend

- (feature request 11373) Support for explicit naming of premises in
   inductive rules for the Coq backend.  For instance, adding the
   [[:RED]] annotation below

   t1 --> t1' [[:RED]] 
   -------------------- :: ctx_app_arg
   v t1 --> v t1'

   results in:

   | ctx_app_arg : forall (v t1 t1':term)
      (RED: reduce t1 t1'),
      is_val_of_term v ->
      reduce (t_app v t1) (t_app v t1').

   Names of rules cannot contain spaces or other non alpha-numerical
   characters, and must begin with a letter. The name annotation must
   at the rightmost place on the hypothesis line, and must be enclosed
   (without spaces) between the [[: and ]] parentheses.

- (feature request 11372) The Coq backend now tries to preserve the
   names the user specified in the definition of grammar rules.  For
   instance the grammar definition below

     grammar 
     term, t :: 't_' ::=                               
       | x            ::  :: Var                  
       | \ x . t      ::  :: Lam     (+ bind x in t +)
       | t t'         ::  :: App                  
       | ( t )        :: S:: Paren   {{ icho [[t]]  }} 
       | { t / x } t' :: M:: Tsub    {{ icho (tsubst_t [[t]] [[x]] [[t']])}}

   generates

     Inductive term : Set := 
      | t_var (x:var)
      | t_lam (x:var) (t:term)
      | t_app (t:term) (t':term).

   instead of 

     Inductive term : Set := 
      | t_var : var -> term
      | t_lam : var -> term -> term
      | t_app : term -> term -> term.

   The old behaviour can be obtained via the top-level option
   -coq_names_in_rules false.

2011.11.17 Version 0.21

- Bump ocamlgraph version to 1.7, to avoid compilation issues with
  OCaml 3.12.1.

- Ported the Isabelle backend to Isabelle2011 (*).

- Experimental support for function definitions.  As a simple example,
  in the Ott file below:

    grammar
     n :: 'n_' ::= 
       | 0       :: :: Zero
       | S n     :: :: Succ

    funs
      Add ::=  {{ hol-proof ... }}
    fun
      n1 + n2 :: n :: add {{ com a function of type num \to num \to num }} 
    by
      0 + n2 === n2
      S n1 + n2 === n1 + S n2

  the add function is compiled into the following coq code:

    Fixpoint add (x1:num) (x2:num) : num:=
      match x1,x2 with
      | n_zero , n2 => n2
      | (n_succ n1) , n2 =>  (add n1 (n_succ n2) ) 
    end.

  The "fun n1 + n2 :: n :: add by" declaration specifies:

  - the name of the function: add
  - the symbolic term that defines the lhs: n1 + n2
  - the symbolic term that defines the rhs: n

  The type of the arguments of the function is defined by the
  non-terminals appearing in the lhs, the return type by the rhs
  non-terminal (so num -> num -> num in the above example).  Functions
  are then defined by case analysis, where the lhs and the rhs are
  separated by the reserved symbol "===".

  The {{ hol-proof }} hom allows the specification of a termination
  proof.

- A new option -fast_parse <bool> generates a faster parser but
  removes the possibility of disambiguating ambiguous terms using the
  :non_terminal: syntax.

- The generated Coq substitution functions now use the list_minus2
  auxiliary function rather than list_filter, as it is easier to
  reason about (since rewriting under quantifiers does not work in
  Coq).  Added the -coq_use_filter_fn option for backwards
  compatibility (*).

- Introduced a new embed hom 

      embed {{ coq-lib foo1 foo2 foo3 }}

  to avoid generation of functions foo1, foo2, foo3 (*)

- No longer generate auxiliary list types for formula_dots in Coq
  backend with -coq_expand_list_types true because today Coq now knows
  how to generate the right induction principle.

- Parsing of defns or embed is more robust wrt newlines (*).

- Various bug-fixes (including #13487), improvements to error reports,
  and performance optimisations.

Entries labelled with (*) were contributed by Viktor Vafeiadis.

2011.11.18 Version 0.21.1

This version fixes a packaging problem of the version 0.21.

2011.12.9 Version 0.21.2

- fix bug 13645: forced use of :nonterm: syntax in conclusions of defn
  rules in 0.21.1 (thanks to Karl Palmskog for reporting the bug).

- Added new hom syntax {{* ... *}} that permits {{ and }} appearing
  inside.  The existing syntax {{ ... }} is also valid.

- Added embed tex-wrap-pre/tex-wrap-post homs to customize tex
  wrapping: the default LaTeX header can be changed by writing 

    embed {{ tex-wrap-pre ... }} 

  and the default footer by writing 

    embed {{ tex-wrap-post ... }}.  

  In addition, the program option -tex_wrap false can be used to omit
  wraping the tex output (-tex_wrap false overrides any
  tex-wrap-pre/tex-wrap-post embeds).

- minor updates to the Hol backend to target the new Hol syntax.

2012.06.12 fix for HOL syntax change

2012.11.29 bugfix 14175

2012.12.04 bugfix  15158


2013.04.20 

- experimental support for generating Lem definitions, including new
  homs lem, lemvar, ichlo


2013.06.22  

- New aux-hom feature:

We permit an aux hom on grammar rules. For any rule with such a hom,
we transform that rule by appending an "_aux" to its primary nonterminal
root name. We then add a synthesised rule with the original nonterminal
root name and a single production, with a shape described by the body of 
the aux hom, which must be of the form  

  {{ aux  foo1 foo2 _ bar1 bar2 bar3 }}

with a single _ and any number of strings fooi and barj before and
after, and no Raw_hom_ident's.  The _ is replaced by the original
nonterminal root name.  

For example, given a grammar or metavariable l of source locations, one
might say 

ntr :: 'NTR_'  ::=  {{ aux _ l }}
 | ...

to synthesise grammars ntr_aux and ntr of unannotated and location-annotated 
terms, the first with all the original productions and the second with a 
single production 
 | ntr l :: :: NTR_aux. 

If the rule has an empty production name wrapper (eg with '' in place
of 'NTR_') then the production name is based on the original
nonterminal root, capitalised and with _aux appended (eg Ntr_aux), to
avoid spurious conflicts.

Generation of aux rules is controlled by a command-line option
-generate_aux_rules {true|false}, which one might (eg) set to false
for latex output and true for OCaml output.

- New {{ texlong }} hom on productions, letting long productions
be typeset with the production extending into the space usually used
for comment, pushing that onto the next line. 

2013.07.04

- replace "make" by "$(MAKE)" in Makefile.  Should fix 15719, reported
  by peterbb@ifi.uio.no for OpenBSD

2013.10.24 Version 0.23

2013.11.17 

- add command-line option -output_source_locations <i>  to include
  comments in the output giving the source locations:
    i=0 adds no locations
    i=1 adds a location for each inductive definition rule
    i=2 also adds a location for other components of the output
  Location annotations are lines of the form

   (* #source file FILENAME1 lines M1 - N1  and ... and FILENAMEk lines Mk - Nk *) 

  (or with % instead of (* *) for the Latex output).
