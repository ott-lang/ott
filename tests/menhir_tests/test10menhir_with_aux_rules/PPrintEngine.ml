     to what will be visible on screen) differs from the length (which is a
     number of bytes, and is reported by [String.length]). We assume, but do
     not check, that fancystrings do not contain a newline character. *)

  (* When in flattening mode, [HardLine] causes a failure, which requires
     backtracking all the way until the stack is empty. When not in flattening
     mode, it represents a newline character, followed with an appropriate
     number of indentation. A common way of using [HardLine] is to only use it
     directly within the right branch of an [IfFlat] construct. *)

  (* The following constructors store their space requirement. This is the
     document's apparent length, if printed in flattening mode. This
     information is computed in a bottom-up manner when the document is
     constructed. *)

  (* In other words, the space requirement is the number of columns that the
     document needs in order to fit on a single line. We express this value in
     the set of `integers extended with infinity', and use the value
     [infinity] to indicate that the document cannot be printed on a single
     line. *)

  (* Storing this information at [Group] nodes is crucial, as it allows us to
     avoid backtracking and buffering. *)

  (* Storing this information at other nodes allows the function [requirement]
     to operate in constant time. This means that the bottom-up computation of
     requirements takes linear time. *)

  (* [Cat (req, doc1, doc2)] is the concatenation of the documents [doc1] and
     [doc2]. The space requirement [req] is the sum of the requirements of
     [doc1] and [doc2]. *)

  | Cat of requirement * document * document

  (* [Nest (req, j, doc)] is the document [doc], in which the indentation
     level has been increased by [j], that is, in which [j] blanks have been
     inserted after every newline character. The space requirement [req] is
     the same as the requirement of [doc]. *)

  | Nest of requirement * int * document

  (* [Group (req, doc)] represents an alternative: it is either a flattened
     form of [doc], in which occurrences of [Group] disappear and occurrences
     of [IfFlat] resolve to their left branch, or [doc] itself. The space
     requirement [req] is the same as the requirement of [doc]. *)

  | Group of requirement * document

  (* [Align (req, doc)] increases the indentation level to reach the current
     column.  Thus, the document [doc] is rendered within a box whose upper
     left corner is the current position. The space requirement [req] is the
     same as the requirement of [doc]. *)
